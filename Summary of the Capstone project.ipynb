    "The client wants to open a business in Manhattan area, so we focus on that borough during the analysis. We define potential neighborhood based on the number of sushi bars which are operating right in each neighborhood. Manhattan has full potential but also is a very challenging district to open a business because of high competition. New sushi bar should be open in an area that inadequate neighborhood in this way the bar can attract more customers. Therefore, this analysis necessary to ensure that we have enough customers and that we are not so close to other sushi places.\n"
